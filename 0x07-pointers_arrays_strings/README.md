 Even more pointers, arrays and strings(Introducing multi-dimensional arrays ,pointers to pointers)
TAsk 0:function that fills memory with a constant byte.
 .The _memset() function fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with the constant byte b
 .Returns a pointer to the memory area s

TASK1:function that copies memory area.
 .The _memcpy() function copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest
 .Returns a pointer to dest

TASK 2:  function that locates a character in a string.
 .Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character c in the string s, or NULL if the character is not found

Task 3:  function that gets the length of a prefix substring.
 .Returns the number of bytes in the initial segment of s which consist only of bytes from accept

Task 4: function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.
 .Returns a pointer to the byte in s that matches one of the bytes in accept, or NULL if no such byte is found

Task 5: function that locates a substring.
 .Returns a pointer to the beginning of the located substring, or NULL if the substring is not found
 .The _strstr() function finds the first occurrence of the substring needle in the string haystack. The terminating null bytes (\0) are not compared

Task 6: function that prints the chessboard.

Task 7: function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.

Task 8:  Double pointer, double fun Write a function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.
